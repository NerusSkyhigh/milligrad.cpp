## C++ implementation of micrograd with support for vectors and parallelization

I got tired of learning C++ via the usual trivial problems so I decided to reimplement [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) in C++. Let's see how far I can go!


### Features
- [x] Computational graph
    - [x] Addition, Subtraction
    - [x] Multiplication, Division
    - [x] Power
    - [ ] Hyperbolic tangent and ReLu
- [x] Autodiff
- [ ] Adam
- [ ] Vector support
- [ ] Parallelization
